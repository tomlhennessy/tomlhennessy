👋 Hey, I'm Tom Hennessy

Software Engineer (Java • Systems • Reliability)
📍 Gold Coast / London

I’m a software engineer focused on backend reliability, clean architecture, and system design.
Currently completing the Metana Software Engineer Career Accelerator, mentored by a Google engineer, where I’m deepening my Java, data structures & algorithms, and distributed systems fundamentals to prepare for a backend or SRE role.

I combine algorithmic thinking with practical systems engineering — designing efficient, fault-tolerant, and observable services built for scalability and simplicity.
